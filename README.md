# Multiclass-Fish-Image-Classification
"This project classifies fish images into multiple categories using deep learning. It trains a CNN from scratch and applies transfer learning with pre-trained models to improve accuracy. Models are saved for reuse, and a Streamlit app is deployed, enabling users to upload fish images and receive real-time category predictions."
